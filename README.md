### Pytris

This Tetris clone was written in Python/Pygame, made in one day and a half.
It's not finished yet, and there might be some bugs to it.

### Dependencies

You need to install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) first.

(After this, you can run the game.py script. Make sure your scores.txt is in the folder
and it has "0" written in it. That would change as you get a new high-score.)

# TODO:
- Saving shapes
- Multiplayer
- Better shape falling
- Better menu
- Better score system
- Better documentation
